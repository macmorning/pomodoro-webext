# Configure the extension

Although the extension is intentionaly kept simple, some features can be explained.

## Custom sounds

The extension supports defining your own notification sound.
The limitations of local storage won't let you use a big file though. If you try to upload a big mp3 file, you will probably see an error such as "Options could not be saved".

Please select a short sound, from a small file. You can get some free SFX files in various places on the Internet.

## Advanced Timers

The default configuration includes a pair of range selectors, used to set the length of streaks and breaks.

If you want a little more than than, go to the options page and check the "Show advanced timers field" and save. Now open the extension popup again and define an even list of commad-separated numbers to describe the lengths of the streaks and breaks in your own loop.

For example, imagine you feel like after 3 streaks, you deserve a longer break. You could configure the advanced timers like this:
```30,5,30,5,30,15```.
